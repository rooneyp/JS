Better Pop Up Blocker 1.0.0 July 26th, 2010
First public version.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.1.0 July 27th, 2010
Fixed the browser action pop up to accept unicode urls.
Injected javascript code now removes itself to prevent other code from being able to parse it's variables.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.1.1 July 27th, 2010
Added support for blocking the less common window.showModalDialog and window.showModelessDialog methods.
Reversed the self-removal of javascript in 1.1.0 since there are easier ways to parse the variables.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.2.0 July 29th, 2010
Added support for preventing infinite prompt/alert/confirm/print/window pop up attacks in Google Chrome when you allow a site to use these functions.
The protection is provided as long as the extension is running and a maximum of 30 for each group of prompt/alert/confirm, print, and window pop ups.
Fixed the use of incorrect regular expressions shown on the Options page. Before, the example regular expressions were not correctly escaped,
but they still whitelisted the sites you want.
V1.2 will automatically corrects the default regular expressions from older versions. Please check your own regular expressions if you followed the examples.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.3.0 August 2nd, 2010
Much better looking whitelister buttons and uses the url bar icon instead of a browser button.
Reworked the blocking for document.createEvent so that it doesn't interfere with sites using it in whitelist mode.
Started to convert Better Pop Up Blocker so that it also works as a Safari extension.

Better Pop Up Blocker 1.5.0 August 4th, 2010
Reworked the reloading of the tabs after a whitelisting option is made with the whitelister so that the applicable tabs are loaded instead of just one.
Better Pop Up Blocker now works as a Safari extension using the same code! Next stop is Firefox.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.0.0 August 8th, 2010
Tweaked the blocking for pop up windows so that it returns true to the calling scripts. 
This fools common pop up scripts into thinking a pop up was actually opened, so they won't try to do an in-page overlay.

You can now see up to 3 blocked pop ups (if any) for a page in the whitelister.

Fixed the text overflow and cut off issue in the whitelister.

Iframes now use the more restrictive of the two blocking policies compared to itself and it's hosting window.
Before the iframe's blocking policy was for it's own url.
However, blocked pop ups opened by an iframe won't be listed in the whitelister because of a Google Chrome restriction in communications with iframes. 
This looks like it might be fixed in coming versions of Google Chrome.

Cleaned up the core code to make it more streamlined. Still waiting for Google Chrome and Apple Safari to get better settings access from content scripts.
For Google Chrome the whitelist/blacklist in the options page now updates live if you keep it open and whitelist/delist sites using the url icon/browser button.
Apple Safari does not seem to want to live update in the options page. Will have to see what is blocking it.

A blacklist option is now implemented in the options page.

Changed the default blocking for document.createEvents to false to maintain best compatibility with websites. This option has been reset for everyone.

The core code is much more efficient due to tracking some of the local storage change events instead of regenerating all the settings on every new page.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.0.2/2.0.3 August 9th, 2010
Minor bug fix release for Google Chrome only. Fixed an issue where blocked urls were not showing up in the whitelister because they were not full urls.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.0 August 10th, 2010
Introduced blinking of the Better Pop Up Blocker icon when it blocks a pop up window. It is turned on by default for everyone, but you can turn it off in options.

Reverted a bit of code to fix an issue in Better Pop Up Blocker 2.0.0 for Apple Safari when the core code was optimized.
Sometimes, the browser icon shown did not match the blocking on the current page when a website was whitelisted/delisted and another tab of the same site is open.
The status would sync up after the user reloaded the page.
This looks like it is a bug in Apple Safari itself where it doesn't fire events for HTML local storage changes like it should. Will be looking more into it.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.1 August 10th, 2010
Worked around a crashing bug in Apple Safari by reloading the currently opened tabs when re-enabling/updating Better Pop Up Blocker.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.2 August 10th, 2010
Fixed a bug where some window.open commands would not work because they used only one argument. Also removed an extra comma.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.3 August 10th, 2010
Improved the compatibility of the window.open commands. It means there should be fewer site compatibility problems. If you had a problem in the past with a website
and using Better Pop Up Blocker, try it now because it is likely fixed.

Pop ups selected to open from the whitelister now appear to the immediate right of the current tab instead of the very far right of the window.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.4 August 15th, 2010
Minor bug fix release while I work on a "very interesting" Google Chrome extension.

More compatibility improvements for window.open.

Fixed a potential issue where a site may not be totally delisted from the whitelist the first time if there are multiple matching rules for the site's url.

Implemented more rigorous url matching.

Added a check so that Google Chrome 5.0 or later is required.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.5 August 26th, 2010

Added a check in the port.js file for Safari to try to solve a crash bug for Safari on Mac users where Safari loses track of a callback. 
This is a known problem with the Safari extension API itself and not with Better Pop Up Blocker.

Better Pop Up Blocker 2.1.6 September 6th, 2010

Did a reset of blockWindowTargets to false for everyone since some users reported site compatibility issues when blocking window targets by default.
